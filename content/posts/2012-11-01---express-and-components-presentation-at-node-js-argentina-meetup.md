I had the pleasure to be invited to talk at the 2nd [node.js Argentina meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NodeJS-Argentina/) about [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com). Because most of the attendees are starting with node the main idea was to introduce some important aspects about this llibrary and the motivations about express.

After a review of the most popular node.js web framework, I introduced [Components](https://github.com/component/component), a brand new package manager for client-side components.

[Here](https://speakerdeck.com/danzajdband/introduccion-a-express-meetup-node-dot-js-argentina) are the slides for the presentation
