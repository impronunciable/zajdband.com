I’ve been working on this node.js twitter library called <a href="https://github.com/danzajdband/Tuiter" target="_blank">Tuiter</a> (That’s how Twitter sounds in spanish). I think it’s mature enough to release the first stable version of the module.

#### Features

For usage and installation steps you can go to the <a href="https://github.com/danzajdband/Tuiter/blob/master/Readme.md" target="_blank">README</a>. This are the most important features:

  * All API methods available (for Search, REST and Streaming APIs)
  * Params preprocessing: Locations as {lat: num,long:num } arrays, allow array params
  * API HTTP Error handling
  * Paging for REST API
  * Custom results for Search API

#### Demo

Few weeks ago I deployed a <a href="https://pure-waterfall-1016.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">demo</a> on Heroku using Tuiter, Google Maps, Socket.IO and ExpressJS. This is just an example of the power of the twitter Streaming API. Can’t wait to see your own demos/apps!

#### State of the art

I’m working on automatic reconnection for the Streaming API calls for a next version. Another feature I want to add is the possibility to filter by location names (like “Buenos Aires” or “Asia” instead of bounding boxes). Stay tuned.
