I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/danzajdband/Tuiter" target="_blank">Tuiter</a>. This new release count with two major features: **Automatic Reconnection** and **Gzip compression**.

#### Automatic Reconnection

Streaming API connections are incredible powerful and it&#8217;s very common to keep those connections open all the time. The thing is <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/concepts#connecting" target="_blank">Twitter closes valid connections</a> very often because of:

  * Duplicate clients logins (earlier connections terminated)
  * Hosebird server restarts (code deploys)
  * Lagging connection terminated (client too slow, or insufficient bandwidth)
  * General Twitter network maintenance (Load balancer restarts, network reconfigurations, other very very rare events)

Following the Twitter Team recommendations I made this simple _Automatic reconnector_ for the library.

#### Gzip compression

Twitter give us the oportunity of reduce the streams to 1/5 size using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/concepts#gzip-compression" target="_blank">Gzip-formatted data</a> via `Accept-encoding` header. Using the header and uncompressing with the help of the node.js core module &#8216;zlib&#8217; now all API calls are performed with this format.

#### State of the art

For the next release I want to improve the performance of the library and the parameters pre-processing. Don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/danzajdband/Tuiter" target="_blank">Fork me on gitHub!</a>
