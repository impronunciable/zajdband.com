    tl;dr: I migrated a small real-world app from Express + MongoDB to Now + Firebase. I&#8217;m happy I was able to do it in ~10 hours and I don&#8217;t need to maintain or spend money on servers (at least for now).

Since [I&#8217;m](https://twitter.com/jdbothma/status/1100714277185433602) [terrible](https://twitter.com/erik_mh/status/1181399247763202048) [at](https://twitter.com/fcaivano/status/849084831959052288) [](https://twitter.com/erik_mh/status/1181399247763202048)[managing](https://twitter.com/lu_cyP/status/922346987487449088) my personal project&#8217;s servers I wanted to believe the hype around Serverless architectures. My intention was to go to a scenario where I don&#8217;t have to worry about scalability, OS vulnerabilities, web servers, SSL certificates or database backups. Time will tell but for now it seems that&#8217;s the case.

## The state where I was in

To start experimenting with this technology I chose [GuriVR](https://gurivr.com). It was a Preact app with a tiny Express backend using MongoDB as the primary database, you can explore the old [codebase](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/guri-vr/tree/3f293ea45b421169e6a8559e3d5df49dcab829d4). It was hosted on a $10/month DigitalOcean droplet along with other apps and sites.

## Changing the mindset

I looked at different platforms and frameworks and decided to give a chance to [Now](https://zeit.co) from Zeit, the magic **now** command played an important part in the decision.

What I understood from the docs is that in the serverless world you get a kind of clean slate on every request. The goal is to return as fast as possible and avoid persistent connection. Firebase was a great fit for my need because it offers two products I needed to implement: Stateless authentication instead of the MongoDB backed user sessions in the old system and the **Firestore** database. One functionality I wasn&#8217;t giving up easily that I got for free in Firebase was the &#8220;passwordless&#8221; authentication.

Besides the database and authentication provider change I haven&#8217;t had to change too much. The Frontend compiles to a static app that **Now** delivers super fast with their Smart CDN. The **Express** app was easy to convert. I just moved each endpoint to a separate file, matching the API structure. For the frontend I used @now/static and for the backend @now/node.

Most of the ~10 hours I had to work on the migration where spent implementing the new firebase authentication and updating the database calls to use Firestore. I also moved the file uploads from AWS S3 to the Firestore Storage service just because I thought it was better to have all the services in the same provider and dashboard ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.

## Platform specific configuration

Besides moving the backend endpoints to different files exporting the lambda functions I had to create a now.json file to hep **Now** figure out how my project should be deployed. This was the first time I did this and I&#8217;m sure there are better ways to do it but this is what I got:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "gurivr",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/**", "use": "@now/node" },
    { "src": "client/dist/**", "use": "@now/static" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/preview", "dest": "api/preview.js" },
    { "src": "/api/stories", "dest": "api/stories.js" },
    { "src": "/api/stories/([^/]+)", "dest": "api/story.js?id=$1" },
    { "src": "/api/assets/search", "dest": "api/assets/search.js", "headers": { "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" } },
    { "src": "/(login|guide|stories)", "dest": "/client/dist/index.html" },
    { "src": "/stories/create", "dest": "/client/dist/index.html" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/client/dist/$1" }
  ],
  "env": {
    "FIREBASE_ADMIN": "@firebase-admin",
    "FLICKR_SECRET_KEY": "@flickr-secret-key",
    "GMAPS_SECRET_KEY": "@gmaps-secret-key",
    "FREESOUND_SECRET_KEY": "@freesound-secret-key",
    "STORAGE_BUCKET": "@storage-bucket"
  }
}</code></pre>

This was maybe the trickiest part of the project but it wasn&#8217;t that hard to be honest. The development phase was a delight. To start a local server I just typed **now dev** and that was it. The node.js backend and the frontend were up in about one second. It also offers live-reload, something that I wasn&#8217;t even expecting üòç. On development mode you can set a _.env_ file to provide environment variables and secrets.

Every time I wanted to see if everything worked well &#8220;in the internets&#8221; I just used the **now** command that returns a nice development url for every deploy.

## The &#8220;deployment&#8221;

This felt like cheating. For deploying to production I had to do 2 things. The first one was setting up the secrets using the **now** tool. This means typing **now secrets add my-secret &#8217;42&#8217;**. Then, to get a production build I executed again the **now** command but with the **&#8211;prod** flag, and that was it (I promise).

## What&#8217;s next?

You can see the [diff](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/guri-vr/commit/b8fe814c90f601679cf32fe022280f3bbf77d3a1) on the codebase and get your own conclusion. My next move will be to figure out how to move this blog and my other projects to this schema.
