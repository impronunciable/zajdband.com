We live in a perfect world for open source and free software. Social networks (like twitter or GitHub at some point) connect us and offer a perfect place to work together on fun and useful projects. A cool thing about this is that you don't have to be a Programmer in order to be a key part of a software project.

One big example is [HacksHackersBA](https://hhba.info) where hackers and journalists share ideas.

That was the context of the [HackDash](https://github.com/danzajdband/hackdash) born. [@blejman](https://twitter.com/blejman) had an idea about a Dashboard for HacksHackersBA hackatons, and I was interested in implement that idea. If the open-source community teached me something is: If you want to show that something is useful, just do it.

So we [started building the app](https://github.com/hhba/hackdash/commit/6de06c5b37f6ed44b9849859e6735d6c456d0c8e) hoping we can get to the [Buenos Aires media party](https://mediaparty.hhba.info) with something that doesn't suck.

The Media Party Hackaton day came followed by a grateful surprise. Not only the people liked the [HackDash implementation](https://hackdash.hhba.info) but a couple of coders added the improvement of the HackDash as a Hackaton project.

After the Media Party I realized that this small app is filling a real need. The Dashboard is been used now in several ways. For example by [Node.js Argentina meetup](https://https://dashboard-ar.jit.su/), [HacksHackersBA](https://hackdash.hhba.info), [La Naci√≥n DataFest](https://hackdash.datafest.org.ar) and [HackasHackersCL](https://ideas.hackshackers.cl/) (using it as a WordPress theme).

Now we are working on our free time for a new version of the web app and looking for more contributors. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:dan.zajdband@gmail.com).
