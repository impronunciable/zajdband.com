I started [HackDash](https://hackdash.org) about [3 years ago](https://zajdband.com/hackdash-putting-ideas-together-solving-problems/) with the hope of improving the way Hackathon projects are followed, presented and shared. [HackDash](https://hackdash.org) was set up as an [open source](github.com/impronunciable/hackdash) project from the beginning allowing us to get amazing people contributing.

Like most Software, HackDash started as a small project and grew at different rates. We learned a lot about the problem we are attacking and have a lot of new ideas and I feel at this point is hard to make them possible with our current design and codebase.

More than 1100 dashboards and 3800 projects validate that HackDash is solving a problem many Events have about showcasing and persisting projects. It is time to use the gained expertise and build a new HackDash allowing more interesting ways to interact in Hackathons and other kind of events. My proposal is to rebuild [HackDash](https://hackdash.org) getting contributors at day 0.

**Contributing**

I created a [Slack Team](https://hackdash-slack.herokuapp.com/) that I invite you to [join](https://hackdash-slack.herokuapp.com/) in order to discuss everything about the development and key decisions in the making of this new version.

I also created the first 2 GitHub repos for the [API](https://github.com/impronunciable/hackdash-api) and the [Web Client](https://github.com/impronunciable/hackdash-web-client). The only decision made, and an important one is the basic development stack. We&#8217;ll use Go for the main backend API, React + Redux for the Web client and Postgres as the main database. The rest is up to discussion.

See you in [Slack](https://hackdash-slack.herokuapp.com/)!
