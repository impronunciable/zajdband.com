Social networks (like twitter or GitHub at some point) connect us and offer a perfect place to work together on fun and useful projects. A cool thing about this is that you don’t have to be a Programmer in order to be a key part of a software project.</p>\n<p>One big example is <a href=\"https://hhba.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HacksHackersBA</a> where hackers and journalists share ideas.</p>\n<p>That was the context of the <a href=\"https://github.com/danzajdband/hackdash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HackDash</a> born. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blejman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@blejman</a> had an idea about a Dashboard for HacksHackersBA hackatons, and I was interested in implement that idea. If the open-source community teached me something is: If you want to show that something is useful, just do it.</p>\n<p>So we <a href=\"https://github.com/hhba/hackdash/commit/6de06c5b37f6ed44b9849859e6735d6c456d0c8e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">started building the app</a> hoping we can get to the <a href=\"https://mediaparty.hhba.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buenos Aires media party</a> with something that doesn’t suck.</p>\n<p>The Media Party Hackaton day came followed by a grateful surprise. Not only the people liked the <a href=\"https://hackdash.hhba.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HackDash implementation</a> but a couple of coders added the improvement of the HackDash as a Hackaton project.</p>\n<p>After the Media Party I realized that this small app is filling a real need. The Dashboard is been used now in several ways. For example by <a href=\"https://https://dashboard-ar.jit.su/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Node.js Argentina meetup</a>, <a href=\"https://hackdash.hhba.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HacksHackersBA</a>, <a href=\"https://hackdash.datafest.org.ar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">La Nación DataFest</a> and <a href=\"https://ideas.hackshackers.cl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HackasHackersCL</a> (using it as a WordPress theme).</p>\n<p>Now we are working on our free time for a new version of the web app and looking for more contributors.
